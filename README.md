### Hi  👋👋👋👋

I don't want to change the world. I just want to change the way we interact with it and programming is a good way to accomplish it.
Every day I challenge myself to imagine new possible solutions for real-world problems and create them by writing new lines of code...🙂





🔭 I’m currently working on Web Development.

🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.

🤔 I’m looking for help with Django.
